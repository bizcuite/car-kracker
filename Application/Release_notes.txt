0.55: Major Release                                                                        
**************************                                                                                           
New:     Debug mode                                                                             
**************************
           Run main modes and tests from the serial terminal by hitting 'd' during bootup
           Loop tests are available, along with cmd fire tests and bus sniffers                 
           Main modes are much more verbose.  Can be read with 'Kracker Status' tab.             

Enter debug mode by pressing the 'd' key over serial within a few seconds of bootup (serial is 115200bps, 8.0.0).  A menu will appear with several tests and modes.  Available modes;

0 - 4: Regular Modes
These are the regular Kracker modes; diagnostic, music, repeat, and remap.  Serial Repeat is most useful for debug and diagnostics

5: Hex Bus Sniffer
Show every incoming byte on the bus, in hex, as it appears.  Stateless, so there is no attempt at message identification

6 - 8: CMD Blast
Issue a message (3 second warning lights blink) on the bus.
* Bus Watch - Issues the message and switches to watching the bus.
* Single - Issues the message once and returns
* Repeat - Issues the message every 10 seconds, ad infinitum

9: Audio Player
Test a wav file stored on SD card.  This does not issue bus commands - it just plays an audio file, outputting it to the audio connector.  Use wasd to change Albums and tracks, and e to return to the debug menu

10: Read Time, Parsed
Request the current time from the dashboard, and parse the result.  This test loops

11: Write to Radio/NAV
Write a test string to the Radio/NAV.  To exit, just hit the enter key without any text     


**************************                                                                                                
New:     LED Notifier
**************************                                                                    
            LED's are updated to note status                                                    
            1: LED's run towards USB jack = EEPROM Read                                         
            2: Towards jack and return = Kbus In                                                
            3: LED's run Away from USB jack = EEPROM Write                                   
            4: Away jack and return = Kbus Out                                               
            5: Continous xoxox = no or bad SD

LED's that run only in one direction are usually just data between the Kracker and computer.  LED's that go one way and return signify kbus Rx/Tx events

There is also a second set of notifications running - the Core Kbus transeiver lights up LED's during kbus events - helpful for scoping
- LED16 (LED farthest from USB jack): On when a byte is being sent
- LED17: Toggles whenever a byte train has been received or transmitted
- LED18: On when a byte is being received
- LED19: Toggles at each bit edge when a byte is being received or transmitted


**************************
New:     Stateless TX/RX engine                                                                     
**************************
            more reliable transfers, with a larger buffer and less memory                           

The new KbusCore object combines kbus-specific methods and general-RX/TX methods.

For general RX/TX, bytes are handled in assembly and loaded into a 256-byte buffer.  RX is always performed before any TX can take place, and there is a time delay between switching events.
The incoming byte stream is turned into messages by testing every incoming byte with the nextcode and holdforcode methods.  These return a found code into codelen, and only take bytes out of the buffer if a code is found

High level Kbus functions are supported, including pattern-matching incoming messages, sending text to the radio, and interrogating the dash.

For message Xmits - the engine uses the second byte of the message as the length and appends the checksum.  to blink the hazzard lights, use; $3f, $05, $00, $0c, $75, $01


**************************
New:     Radio button Remaps                                                                        
**************************
            Remap radio buttons to other functions using the Kustomizer                             
            Display car data on the radio display                                                   
            Remap CD buttons to CD+ and CD- to support more albums        

When in music mode, the Kracker can trigger alternate actions when the RAD/Nav buttons are pushed.  By mapping a CD button to 'Next CD', you can have more than 5 albums.  You can also issue text to the radio like the current time or temperature.

Kracker output volume can also be controlled, either as a default set through the kustomizer, or dynamically mapped to the RAD/Nav buttons.  An Aux-in mode turns off audio playback while still simulating a CD changer, so you can add your own audio source.
